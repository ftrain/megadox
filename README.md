To Claude Code, giving it a forked repo:

I want you to look through every aspect of that code base and create an encyclopedic guide to the entire platform. It's a historic codebase so branches and historical commits relate to the history and are very important to understand—what changed, what stayed the same. Be mindful of the original hardware. 

I want to be able to learn every aspect of how the software works from what you produce. It should be in the format of literate programming with text leading code, and code formatted. Go area by area, think, and write slowly.

The end result should be a huge set of markdown files with embedded code compiled into an epub perhaps with pandoc, and a nice PDF too. 

When done I want you to check out each major commit and milestone and describe in detail how the coding changed. I'm interested in what the developers learned and how their patterns of work changed, and how the community evolved.

Write up a full introduction, provide a glossary, and in general create the most thorough reference work possible -- a true work of expertise and care. Create an index and liberally cross-reference everything you find. Spin up lots of agents to do all of this in parallel. 

Ultrathink.
