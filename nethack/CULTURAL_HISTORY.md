# NetHack: A Comprehensive Cultural History and Impact Analysis

## 1. Origins and Development History (1987-Present)

### The Beginning

NetHack is an open-source single-player roguelike video game first released in 1987, representing a fork of the 1984 game Hack, which itself was inspired by the 1980 game Rogue.

Mike Stephenson took on the role as maintainer of the Hack source code, then decided to create a new fork. He brought in novel ideas from Izchak Miller and Janet Walz. They called themselves the DevTeam and renamed their branch NetHack since their collaboration work was done over the Internet.

**Historical Significance:** NetHack is notable for having been one of the earliest programs in which the development group was consciously organized as a distributed collaboration over the Internet.
