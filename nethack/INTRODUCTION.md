## About NetHack

NetHack is one of the oldest and most complex computer games still in active development. First released in 1987 and based on the original Rogue (1980) and Hack (1985), NetHack has evolved over nearly four decades into a sprawling, intricate roguelike adventure that has captivated generations of players.

### What is NetHack?

NetHack is a single-player dungeon exploration game where you descend into the Mazes of Menace to retrieve the legendary Amulet of Yendor for your deity. Along the way, you'll face 394 different types of monsters, discover over 430 unique items, navigate complex dungeon branches, solve puzzles, and ultimately ascend to demigodhood if you succeed.

The game features:
- **Permanent death** - When you die, your character is gone forever (though ghosts may haunt your next game)
- **Procedural generation** - Every game creates a unique dungeon layout
- **Emergent gameplay** - The interaction of complex systems creates endless possibilities
- **ASCII graphics** - Traditional character-based display (with optional tile sets)
- **Turn-based gameplay** - Take your time to make strategic decisions
- **Incredible depth** - After 35+ years, players still discover new interactions

### The NetHack Philosophy

NetHack embodies several core principles:

**"The DevTeam thinks of everything"** - This famous phrase captures NetHack's legendary attention to detail. Nearly every action you can imagine has been implemented and will have consequences. Dip a cockatrice corpse in a potion? You'll turn the potion to stone. Throw a cream pie at a floating eye? It won't be able to paralyze you with its gaze. The game rewards creative thinking and punishes assumptions.

**Emergence over scripting** - Rather than scripted encounters, NetHack creates interesting situations through the interaction of its systems. A monster might trigger a trap, drink a potion, or use a wand. Your pet might steal from a shop. A random boulder might fall on the exact item you needed.

**Permadeath creates meaning** - Because death is permanent, every decision matters. Resources are precious. Identification is crucial. Risk management becomes an art form.

**Complexity is rewarding** - NetHack doesn't hold your hand. It expects you to learn through experimentation, death, and gradual mastery. Ascending (winning) for the first time is a genuine achievement that may take months or years.

## A Brief History of NetHack

### From Rogue to Hack (1980-1985)

The roguelike genre began with **Rogue** (1980), created by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman at UC Santa Cruz. Rogue introduced the core concepts: procedural dungeons, permadeath, ASCII graphics, and turn-based tactical combat.

**Hack** (1985) was created by Jay Fenlason and expanded significantly by Andries Brouwer. It added shops, more monsters, a richer item system, and many of the systems that would become NetHack staples.

### The Birth of NetHack (1987)

In 1987, Mike Stephenson began coordinating development of "New Hack" or "NetHack," bringing together contributions from developers around the world (hence "Net"). The first release, NetHack 1.3d, was published in July 1987.

### Major Milestones

- **1987**: NetHack 1.3d - First release
- **1989**: NetHack 2.3 - Introduction of classes and quest system
- **1989**: NetHack 3.0 - Major rewrite, added Mazes of Menace
- **1993**: NetHack 3.1 - Quest branches, artifacts, conduct system
- **1996**: NetHack 3.2 - Improved AI, more monsters and items
- **2000**: NetHack 3.3 - Enhanced magic system, new levels
- **2003**: NetHack 3.4 - Balance changes, bug fixes (last release until 2015)
- **2015**: NetHack 3.6.0 - After 12 years, major update with new content
- **2020**: NetHack 3.6.6 - Continued refinement
- **2023**: NetHack 3.7.0 - Current version, ongoing development

### The DevTeam

NetHack has been developed by the "DevTeam," a group of volunteers who maintain the game anonymously. Members have changed over the decades, but their commitment to quality and attention to detail has remained constant. The DevTeam releases updates irregularly, sometimes with years between versions, but each release is thoroughly tested.

## About This Encyclopedia

### Purpose and Scope

This encyclopedia serves as a comprehensive reference for NetHack 3.7, documenting every aspect of the game from both a player and technical perspective. Whether you're trying to identify a monster, understand a game mechanic, find an item, or explore the source code, this encyclopedia provides detailed, accurate information.

The encyclopedia includes:

1. **Complete Monster Catalog** - All 394 monsters with stats, attacks, behaviors, and AI
2. **Complete Item Compendium** - All 430+ items with properties, effects, and interactions
3. **Game Mechanics** - Detailed explanations of combat, magic, status effects, and systems
4. **Strategies and Tactics** - From early game survival to ascension strategies
5. **Technical Reference** - Source code architecture, data structures, and implementation
6. **Community Culture** - History, variants, achievements, and the NetHack community

### How to Use This Encyclopedia

**New Players** should start here in the Introduction, then read the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) to familiarize themselves with NetHack terminology. After that, explore Part II of the [Master Index](INDEX.md) to learn about the game world, then Part IV for basic strategies.

**Intermediate Players** will find Part III (Game Mechanics) and Part IV (Advanced Tactics) most valuable, along with the detailed monster and item references when facing specific challenges.

**Advanced Players** can dive into Part VI (Technical Reference) to understand the deep mechanics, explore the source code organization, and study the monster/item databases for optimization.

**Developers and Modders** should focus on Part VI, which documents the codebase architecture, data structures, and file organization. The JSON databases and source file references will be particularly useful.

**Academic Researchers** studying game design, procedural generation, or emergent gameplay will find the History section, Technical Reference, and Bibliography valuable.

### Navigation

The encyclopedia uses a hierarchical structure:

- **[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)** - Master index with all topics organized into six parts
- **[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md)** - Alphabetical reference of all NetHack terms
- **[BIBLIOGRAPHY.md](BIBLIOGRAPHY.md)** - Sources, references, and external resources
- **Topic Documents** - Detailed documentation (Monster Catalog, Item Compendium, etc.)
- **Source Code References** - Direct links to relevant files in the codebase

Cross-references throughout the encyclopedia use markdown links to help you navigate between related topics.

### What Makes NetHack Special

After 35+ years, NetHack remains actively played and developed because of several unique qualities:

**Depth of Interaction** - NetHack has an astonishing number of interactions between systems. With 394 monster types, 430+ item types, multiple schools of magic, environmental hazards, and complex AI, the possible combinations are nearly endless. Players continue discovering new interactions decades after release.

**Emergent Narratives** - Every game creates its own story. A lucky early wish can lead to an overpowered character. A careless mistake can end a promising run. A desperate gambit might save you or doom you. Players remember their games not as scripted events but as emergent stories of triumph and tragedy.

**Fair but Unforgiving** - NetHack is brutally difficult, but almost every death is fair. The game provides information and tools to survive; it's up to you to use them wisely. The famous acronym "YASD" (Yet Another Stupid Death) captures this - most deaths come from player mistakes, not random chance.

**Community Knowledge** - NetHack has an active community that has collectively explored the game's depths for decades. The NetHack Wiki, community forums, and public servers create a shared knowledge base. Yet even with all this documentation, new discoveries still happen.

**Replay Value** - With 13 roles, 5 races, 3 alignments, procedural generation, and optional conduct challenges, NetHack offers endless replay value. Speedrunners compete for fastest times, conduct runners attempt all-conduct ascensions, and casual players enjoy the journey.

**Active Development** - Unlike most games from the 1980s, NetHack continues to receive updates. The DevTeam's careful stewardship has kept the game challenging, balanced, and bug-free while adding new content and refining systems.

## Core Concepts

Before diving into the encyclopedia, here are some essential NetHack concepts:

### Character Creation

You choose three aspects at game start:

1. **Role** (class) - Your character's profession (13 options)
   - Archeologist, Barbarian, Caveman, Healer, Knight, Monk, Priest, Ranger, Rogue, Samurai, Tourist, Valkyrie, Wizard

2. **Race** (5 options)
   - Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Orc

3. **Alignment** (3 options, restricted by role)
   - Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic

These choices determine starting stats, items, skills, quest, and some game mechanics.

### The Goal

Your quest has several stages:

1. **Early Game** - Survive and explore (Dungeons of Doom, Gnomish Mines)
2. **Quest** - Complete your role-specific quest for an artifact (levels 14-20)
3. **Mid Game** - Gather the ascension kit (resistance, speed, gear)
4. **Castle** - Raid the castle for the wand of wishing
5. **Valley of the Dead** - Enter Gehennom
6. **Gehennom** - Navigate Hell and defeat demon lords
7. **Wizard's Tower** - Defeat the Wizard of Yendor
8. **Invocation** - Gather Bell, Book, and Candelabrum; perform the ritual
9. **Sanctum** - Retrieve the Amulet of Yendor from Moloch's Sanctum
10. **Ascension** - Fight through the Elemental Planes and Astral Plane to offer the Amulet to your deity

### Permadeath and Learning

When you die in NetHack, your character is gone. Your bones file may generate a ghost that haunts future games, but otherwise, you start completely fresh. This makes NetHack a game of knowledge accumulation. Each death teaches you something: a new monster ability, an item interaction, a trap type, or a tactical error.

Experienced players can ascend reliably because they've internalized thousands of these lessons. New players should expect many deaths before their first ascension. This is normal and part of the game's appeal.

### Key Resources

**Hit Points (HP)** - Your health. Reaching 0 HP means death.

**Power (Pw)** - Your magical energy for casting spells.

**Nutrition** - Your hunger level. Starving is dangerous but being satiated has penalties.

**Inventory** - Limited by weight carrying capacity and 52 inventory slots (a-z, A-Z).

**Gold** - Used for shops, donations, and bribes.

**Experience (XP/XL)** - Gained from killing monsters and actions; raises your level.

### Essential Mechanics

**Identification** - Most items start unidentified. Learning what items do is crucial. Methods include:
- Using/testing items
- Scroll of identify or identify spell
- Price identification in shops
- Special methods (touchstone for gems, etc.)

**Beatitude (BUC)** - Items are blessed, uncursed, or cursed:
- Blessed items have enhanced effects
- Uncursed items work normally
- Cursed items may have negative effects and can "weld" to your body

**Armor Class (AC)** - Your defense. Lower is better (can go negative).

**Magic Cancellation (MC)** - Protects against magical attacks (0-3, higher is better).

**Resistances** - Immunity to specific damage types (fire, cold, shock, poison, sleep, disintegration).

**Intrinsics** - Permanent abilities gained from eating monster corpses or other sources.
